             Welcome to my about me page! If you want to know more about me, i'll let you in on a little secret. Just keep reading :) I am a highschool graduate from the class of 2020 at CodeRVA regional highschool. I hope to use the computer science skills as well as the life lessons ive learned from highschool in general to better myself and become someone that all of my friends and family will be proud of. I plan to go to a college called Virgina State university during fall of 2020 and graduate before 2024.
